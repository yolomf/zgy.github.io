Tongtong is my everything, and my love for her is unshakable. I wish we can continue walking together for a long time! 

Below is a blog about the little moments in our daily life.

2025.1.10: went to Shichahai and be together. It was so cold that night, but nothing can stop two passionate hearts from drawing close to each other.

2025.2.8: back from winter vacation filled with missing, we went to Peking Univ. by foot. Although boasting more twisted paths through twilight shades, I still deem PKU nothing more romantic than THU :").

2025.2.14: Valentine's Day! I had no idea what to do in this day, so we climbed the mountain. We chose a classic route of Fragrant Hills--Western Hill--Badachu Park. She was much more energetic and strong than I had thought!

2025.2.22: went to Yuyuantan Park, Olympic Sports Center and watched a talk show. The landscape was beautiful--person even more, but frequent gale made it hard to take perfect photo of her. But it doesn't matter, hair, clothes, etc. all those factors can't change the fact that she is beatiful.
