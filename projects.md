Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

- **[autoE_Mgun](https://github.com/CBDT-JWT/autoE_Mgun)**

> The background of this project is the Hardware Design Competition hosted by THUee, so it may not seem closely related to my research direction. Our electromagnetic cannon falls under the category of resistive-type electromagnetic guns. By discharging a large capacitor in a short time, the projectile is launched at an extremely high speed. To enhance productivity and improve the automation of the electromagnetic cannon, we introduced an automatic aiming system, which allows the cannon's sight to automatically scan for human targets and aim at the heart, enabling autonomous strikes without human intervention. At the same time, we hope to contribute to sustainable development, so we incorporated an energy recovery system in the circuit, which significantly reduces the power consumption of the electromagnetic cannon.
