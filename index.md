# About Me

I am a second-year student at the Department of Electronic Engineering at Tsinghua University. Currently, my primary research focus is on large-scale speech models.

I like doing sports, including playing badminton, table tennis, soccer, hiking, and so on. I am also fond of photography, although I don't have a professional camera yet. You can find my works on [this page](photography.md).

You can find more information about me on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/z-gy).
